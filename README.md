# KiCad Model of Logical Devices' ALLPRO88 Pin Driver

This provides a KiCad [schematic](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18313981/pin_driver.pdf) of the pin driver used in Logic Devices' ALLPRO88 software-driven device programmer.  The service manual scans available on the internet are missing the pages containing the pin driver circuitry.  I believe the schematic is correct, it's certainly correct enough for me to have repaired many of these modules based on what's here, but I found errors as recently as the fall of 2024 so I wouldn't say it's definitely correct.  Your mileage might vary.

There is no PCB layout.  The PCBs from Logic Devices have enough component designators marked in the silk screen to find parts and associate them with the schematic.
